# 🎯 QUANTUM MECHANIC - SESSION 21 - FULL GENERATION

## AudioSystem.cs - Complete Audio & Sound Management Framework

Generate complete audio and sound system in 3 chunks as artifacts:

### CHUNK 1 (140 lines): Audio Core Framework
- AudioManager singleton (master audio control)
- Audio channel system (Music, SFX, Voice, Ambient, UI)
- Volume control and mixing (per-channel volumes)
- AudioClip pooling and caching
- Audio source pooling (object pooling for performance)
- Audio settings (mute, volume persistence)
- Audio fade in/out system
- 3D spatial audio support (positional sound)
- Audio priority system (interrupt/override logic)

### CHUNK 2 (140 lines): Music & Ambience System
- Music track manager (playlist, crossfade)
- Dynamic music system (combat/exploration transitions)
- Music layers (adaptive music intensity)
- Ambient sound zones (environmental audio)
- Weather sound effects (rain, wind, thunder)
- Day/night ambient transitions
- Music state machine (menu, gameplay, boss, victory)
- Looping and one-shot audio handling
- Random sound variation (pitch/volume randomization)

### CHUNK 3 (120 lines): Advanced Audio Features
- Sound effect triggering system (animation events, gameplay events)
- Footstep system (surface-based sounds)
- Voice line system (dialogue integration)
- Audio occlusion (muffled sound through walls)
- Reverb zones and audio effects
- Audio snapshot system (underwater, muffled, etc.)
- Audio mixer integration
- Audio event system (play sound on event)
- Audio debug visualizer (playing sounds overlay)
- Audio profiler (memory and performance tracking)

**Namespace:** `QuantumMechanic.Audio`
**Dependencies:** SaveSystem, DialogueSystem, EventSystem
**Total:** ~400 lines with XML docs

## Integration Notes for Session 21:
- Link audio to dialogue system for voice lines
- Connect music to combat system (dynamic intensity)
- Ambient audio tied to weather and time-of-day systems
- Footstep sounds based on terrain/surface types
- Audio settings persistence via save system
- Performance optimization through object pooling
- Support for audio modding (custom sound packs)
